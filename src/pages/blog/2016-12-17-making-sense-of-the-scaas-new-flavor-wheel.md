### Hi. I'm glad to say about me!

I'm front-end(FE) developer. And I work at LINE. I started FE developing 6 years ago. I'm trying to follow FE trends.

As you may know, FE environment is changing very fast! And I have to adjust it for my family and my personal satisfaction.. 

So, The first purpose of these post is to memorize it. And second is to share my knowledge with someone.
